//LAZY PROPAGATION
/*
Be like a master procrastinator. Do work only when you absolutely need it.
Don't update a node's children until they are needed for a new query.
This will save a lot of time, and even in some cases make solutions go from O(MN) to O(Mlog(N)).
You can't outsmart the procrastinator.

How do I know when I have to update the children?
The effective approach we will use is to have a lazy boolean:
if lazy is true, we will need to update the children eventually (this node was changed when doing the previous query)
if lazy is false, we do not need to update the children

Problems with using boolean lazy value:
Multiple updates pending to children will cause them to only think they have 1 update.
Solution:
Instead of using a boolean for lazy, make the lazy value an integer.
The integer represents the number of pending rotations/dial pressings.

Problem: You, as a node, came into the funciton with pending updates (or rotations).
Solution: Call push_down function inside of the query function, at the VERY BEGINNING

Problem: Child wasn't updating
Solution: Don't listen to Sat, he was lying, apply changes to the node value in the push_down function
